major update.  the entire application has been re-written from scratch.
the new layout allows languages and codecs to be added much easier than
prior releases.

- removed pacpl-install
- removed daemon mode (this may be re-implemented in a future release)
- removed --playlist option
- removed --play function
- removed support for kexis (kxs).  if anyone was actually using this
  format I apologize, but the programs inability to specify an output 
  file just wouldn't work with the new system.

+ added ability to alter/add meta-data during conversion via tagging opts
+ added configure and makefile for installation (replaces pacpl-install)
+ added --to option. this replaced --ct and the --formattoformat options
+ added --only option. with this option, only files matching .ext will
  get converted. (eg: pacpl --to wav --only flac /home/directory/) only
  converts files ending in .flac to wav
+ added --dryrun option.  this was inspired/suggested by Stefano Sabatini
+ added --verbose option. useful in conjunction with --dryrun
+ added language po-like files. translators (as always) are welcome.
+ added the following video types to the video->audio conversions:
  svcd, m4v, nsv, nuv, psp, and smk.

* update all files are now converted to wav first, then to the desired
  output format.  in the future this will allow normalization, gain, etc.
* update slackware package now uses the new kde installation directory /usr
* update a large portion of the amarok script has been re-written.

  string (artist, title, etc)...as opposed to any tag containing the string.  
  thanks to Edward Kear for reporting this issue.
