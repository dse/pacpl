./configure
make
make install

if you would like to exclude the amarok, dolphin and konqueror plugins
you will have to specify this during configure:

./configure --without-amarok --without-dolphin --without-konq 

the default KDEDIR is /usr.  You can change this during installation if
necessary by using:

make KDEDIR=/opt/kde install

use the following to find the correct path: kde-config --prefix

perl modules note:

pacpl-install has been removed.  there is however a script in the
extra/ directory called mod-install.sh which will try to install all
the required perl modules via CPAN.

please keep in mind the following...

Ogg::Vorbis::Header needs libogg and libvorbis installed
Audio::FLAC::Header needs flac installed

(actual package names will vary based on your distribution)

(K)Ubuntu users need to make sure the build-essential package is installed
before attempting to install the required perl modules or the libraries 
mentioned above.

cp pacpl /usr/bin

mkdir /etc/pacpl
mkdir /etc/pacpl/po
mkdir /etc/pacpl/modules

-- where you copy pacpl.conf all depends on your preference. --

cp pacpl.conf /etc/pacpl (global)
cp pacpl.conf ~/.pacplrc (local)

cp extra/sample.m /etc/pacpl/modules

cp po/* /etc/pacpl/po

mkdir /usr/doc/pacpl-4.0.0 (change 4.0.0 to the actual version)

cp README COPYING TODO ChangeLog AUTHORS INSTALL /usr/doc/pacpl-4.0.0
cp -R extra/ /usr/doc/pacpl-4.0.0

cd extra/

./mod-install.sh (this will attempt to install all the required modules)

mkdir $KDEDIR/share/apps/amarok/scripts/pacx
cp plugins/amarok/pacx $KDEDIR/share/apps/amarok/scripts/pacx

cp plugins/dolphin/pacpl.desktop $KDEDIR/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus

cd plugins/konqueror/
cp pacpl.desktop $KDEDIR/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
cp mimes/* $KDEDIR/share/mimelnk/audio/

in the above example, you'll need to replace $KDEDIR with your actual
KDE installation directory.  on most distributions this is /usr.
